## Introduction

This Node.js application : Design and implement a backend system that efficiently manages requests from multiple users using a queue structure. Each client connected will have its queue where all requests will be processed sequentially. The system should be robust and scalable, ensuring that the queue is empty once all requests are processed and all users disconnect.


## Features

1. User Authentication : Securely authenticate users before they can enqueue requests.
2. Request Queueing : Implement a queue for each client to handle requests in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner.
3. Request Processing : Develop a process to handle and execute requests sequentially.
4. Concurrency Management : Handle multiple clients and their queues concurrently.
5. Scalability : Ensure the system can scale to handle an increasing number of users and requests without degradation in performance.
6. Robustness : Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms to manage failures without data loss.
7. Logging and Monitoring : Set up logging for tracking request handling and system monitoring for performance metrics.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- MongoDB installed and running.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Aizaz6198/Backend-System-Design-Using-Queue.git

## Usage
Start the server:
    npm start
    
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

## Configuration

Create a .env file in the root of your project with the following content:

-MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://yourusername:yourpassword@cluster0.iaiuzrt.mongodb.net/your-database.

-SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key.

-PORT=3000.

Adjust the MongoDB URI as needed.
